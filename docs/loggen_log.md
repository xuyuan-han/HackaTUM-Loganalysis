User's question is: Summerize the general and concise summary of the given log file under 500 words, mainly focused on all different kinds of unusual ssh actions, such as invalid users and so on. This summerization will be used by experts for debugging, so please make sure it is accurate and do not need to explain simple definitions.

The log file shows multiple instances of unusual SSH actions. Each entry consists of an error message followed by the source IP address and port number responsible for the disconnection. Here are the summarized details of those events:

1. At 05:06:52, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.24.11.230, port 47070. The connection was closed by the remote host.

2. At 05:07:01, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.25.11.232, port 40170. The connection was closed by the remote host.

3. At 05:07:01, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.25.232.145, port 49528. The connection was closed by the remote host.

4. At 05:07:01, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 10.0.54.68, port 38892. The connection was closed by the remote host.

5. At 05:09:41, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.25.11.231, port 42174. The connection was closed by the remote host.

6. At 05:09:49, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.24.11.231, port 37556. The connection was closed by the remote host.

7. At 05:09:52, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 192.168.85.173, port 39400. The connection was closed by the remote host.

These entries indicate multiple unsuccessful SSH connection attempts, where the remote hosts (identified by IP addresses) failed to establish a connection due to some unidentified issue. It is recommended to further investigate the cause of these connection failures to ensure the security of the SSH server.

assistant_summarizer (to ragproxyagent):

There are several SSH actions described in the given log file. Here is a concise summary focusing on the different kinds of unusual SSH actions, such as invalid user attempts:

1. Invalid User Attempts:
   - The log records multiple instances where the SSH connection was closed by the remote host after the `kex_exchange_identification` error message.
   - The connection closure was initiated by various IP addresses, such as:
     - 172.24.11.230 (port 47070)
     - 172.25.11.232 (port 40170)
     - 172.25.232.145 (port 49528)
     - 10.0.54.68 (port 38892)
     - 172.25.11.231 (port 42174)
     - 172.24.11.231 (port 37556)
     - 192.168.85.173 (port 39400)

Please note that the provided summary is specific to unusual SSH actions, focusing on invalid user attempts.

The log file shows multiple instances of unusual SSH actions. Each entry consists of an error message followed by the source IP address and port number responsible for the disconnection. Here are the summarized details of those events:

1. At 05:06:52, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.24.11.230, port 47070. The connection was closed by the remote host.

2. At 05:07:01, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.25.11.232, port 40170. The connection was closed by the remote host.

3. At 05:07:01, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.25.232.145, port 49528. The connection was closed by the remote host.

4. At 05:07:01, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 10.0.54.68, port 38892. The connection was closed by the remote host.

5. At 05:09:41, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.25.11.231, port 42174. The connection was closed by the remote host.

6. At 05:09:49, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 172.24.11.231, port 37556. The connection was closed by the remote host.

7. At 05:09:52, there was a failed SSH connection from IP address 192.168.85.173, port 39400. The connection was closed by the remote host.

These entries indicate multiple unsuccessful SSH connection attempts, where the remote hosts (identified by IP addresses) failed to establish a connection due to some unidentified issue. It is recommended to further investigate the cause of these connection failures to ensure the security of the SSH server.

You're a retrieve augmented coding assistant. You answer user's questions based on your own knowledge and the
context provided by the user.
If you can't answer the question with or without the current context, you should reply exactly `UPDATE CONTEXT`.
For code generation, you must obey the following rules:
Rule 1. You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.
Rule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:

User's question is: Summerize the general and concise summary of the given log file under 500 words, mainly focused on all different kinds of unusual ssh actions, such as invalid users and so on. This summerization will be used by experts for debugging, so please make sure it is accurate and do not need to explain simple definitions.

15. Nov 10 05:02:52 - CMX50070-101776 sshd[1917238]: Connection closed by 10.0.54.70 port 35226
16. Nov 10 05:03:03 - CMX50070-101776 sshd[1918462]: error: kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host

The log file shows multiple instances of SSH connections being closed by remote hosts. These connections were initiated from various IP addresses, such as 172.24.26.38, 172.25.11.233, 10.0.54.75, 172.25.11.232, 172.25.232.145, 10.0.54.73, 172.24.11.230, 10.0.54.70, and 10.0.54.68.

These actions can be considered unusual because they indicate failed SSH connections resulting in closure. The reason for these connection closures seems to be related to "kex_exchange_identification" errors. 

Please note that this summary is based on the provided log file, and further analysis may be required for a comprehensive understanding of the SSH actions.
